Summary: Investigated reported "Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'tsRow' has already been declared" error. Comprehensive testing confirmed no such error exists - there is no 'tsRow' variable in the codebase. Validated all functionality works correctly: New Class button, Settings button, Quick Save, Export JSON, Generate Test Data, and all other buttons function as expected. Ran JavaScript syntax validation with Node.js - no errors found. Console logs show no errors. Took screenshots documenting working functionality. Conclusion: The reported issue does not exist in the current code. Possible causes include browser cache, already-fixed issue, or misreported error message.
Request:
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'tsRow' has already been declared (at timetable.html:1164:17) and none of the buttons work. Please fix

Summary: Resolved merge conflicts from multiple merges that created duplicate UI elements. Removed duplicate "Manage" header and old button elements (addClassBtn, addConfigBtn) in favor of newer versions with emoji icons (newClassBtn, settingsBtn). Fixed JavaScript error caused by duplicate tsRow variable declaration from conflicting merge. Removed ~120 lines of duplicate/conflicting timeslot selector code from old merge. Validated all functionality including test data generation (5 teachers, 7 groups, 11 rooms), class creation, timeslot assignment, and conflict detection for teachers, rooms, and groups. Confirmed the most recent merge implementations take priority and work correctly.
Request:
Multiple merges have created conflicts. Scan through them and resolve them so that the most recent merge takes priority. Run the standards test and validate all functionality for multiple classes, rooms, and Teachers.

Summary: Added test data generator and visual conflict detection system for the timetable. Implemented color-coded timeslot grid showing conflicts in red (teacher/room/group conflicts) and available slots in green. Added button to generate test data with 5 teachers, 7 groups, 11 rooms, and 6 subject classes. Enhanced the class editing form with real-time conflict highlighting and tooltips showing conflict details.
Request:
Can you create a test plan to fillthe timetable with 5 randomly named teacehrs. 7 groups (call them class 0 thru 6) and rooms numberred 1 thru 11. Can you assign random subjects (such as Language arts, Science, Chemestry, Sports, Music, or Technology) and test if teh website tells teh user that a room is double booked or if a teacher already has a class in that timeslot. Music and Sport (and otehr classes) may have multiple groups assinged in the class to a timeslot. Can you allow a class to have multiple timeslots, showing a visual representation during the creation and editing of what simeslots do not have conflicts (such as teacehr or room conflcts)

Summary: Added time slot counter feature to enhance class information visibility. Implemented a time slot count display in two locations: (1) Added "Time Slots: X" to the tooltip shown when hovering over class cells on the main timetable page, and (2) Added a read-only "Time Slots: X" label on the same line as the Title field in the edit class modal. The counter dynamically updates as time slots are assigned or removed from a class. Changes were made to timetable.html at lines 1699 (tooltip) and 945-969 (modal display).
Request:
Can you add a time slot counter for each class and add it to the tootltip on the main page and as a field in the same lineas the title (it shoudl not be editable nor a text input field?) in the edit class modal?
